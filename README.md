# bully-bot
This is the Bully Bot to bully people.

It's just like actually a super simple interaction with the Discord API.
Literally the getting started page
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html
but with some more conditions.

You'll have to add your own insults because that is the 'secret sauce' (and also it's kind of ugly because I just use a list inside the code instead of calling from another document because I'm lazy.

Enjoy, Ben!
